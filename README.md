# Human Resources Databases

This project consisted in the analysis, planning and implementation of one relational and two non-relational databases for HR. The team was given the relational database, in **Oracle Database**, which served as the basis for the other ones.

The non-relational databases were implemented in **MongoDB** and **Neo4j**. Afterwards, the team created and implemented a common set of queries in all three databases, in order to compare their performance, as well as a few extra queries per database that played to their strenghts specifically.

The assignment was developed in **NoSQL Databases**, an optional subject of the Master's degree (2020/21).
